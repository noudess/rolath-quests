Ahh, alas, it would be better to let you decide for yourself, perhaps you would even like to master them all! That would be quite a feat. Well, lets not get ahead of ourselves, here, take this book. When you have finished reading it, ask me for the [second book], and I shall give it to you. Inside them you will find the most basic recipes for each trade. These recipes are typically used as a base for more advanced crafting, for instance, if you wished to be a smith, one would need to find some ore and smelt it into something usable. Good luck!");
