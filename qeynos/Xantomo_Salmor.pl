They packed and left their respective cities and set out to find their companions. One by one, they joined together until all were united once again. Many tales were told and memories revisited. Time was short though, and adventure soon found them. A grizzled and ancient being appeared before them. Do you know [what it said]?");

Their knowledge of Norrath was put to the test against the many others of differing faiths. Soon, the fellowship realized the completion of their challenge. They had triumphed against the odds yet again, succeeding where many others had failed. Their reward was very simple. The ancient being pulled from thin air, a silver, glowing scroll. This scroll was entrusted to few, but I myself have a copy. Do you care to hear me read it aloud?");

The scroll bears the names of Heroes. I shall read them for you now. Citaria, Lujan, Tierra, Rennol, Hakeshar, Syngr, Alshain, Reeannon, Kurzog, Amnion, Arnaxus and Vaslin. I am charged with scribing the names of future heroes now that the being has left our plane. Perhaps you can hear your name read from this scroll one day $name");
