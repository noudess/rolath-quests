To the west, the human farmers in the Plains of Karana are beset upon by vicious tribes of Gnolls and must valiantly defend their farms. Closer to home the Death Fist Orcs and Goblin Clans Runnyeye and Pick Claws all attempt to control the Misty Thicket and chop down its sturdy trees for lumber. If you are planning on leaving the safety of Rivervale I advise you to deliver this note to Bartle Barnick. He will help you get yourself outfitted for survival in the wilds. When he has outfitted you in a suit of protective leather return here for [further instruction].");

The crumbling walls that surround the cursed fields are believed to have been constructed around the same time as the ruined tower and the great wall of Cetelt. We Storm Reapers believe that the walls once surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens. The arrogance of the caretaker of the gardens offended the Gods and in turn the gardens were cursed with disease and an evil power that animates the corpses of the dead. The Scarecrow, Old Gourdhead, stands in one of these two fields and warns passers by that it is an accursed place. Recently someone has been placing rats in the fields to become diseased.");

The person responsible has committed great offenses to the ways of Karana and the people of Rivervale and must be stopped. Should you identify the individual responsible slay them and bring their head to me and you shall be rewarded for your deed. It is a shame that our otherwise peaceful lives must occasionally be interrupted by the necessity for bloodshed.");

Such behavior is practically unheard of among the kind people of Rivervale. Take this dull scimitar and sharpen it in the forge here at the Tagglefoots Farm with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done give the sharpened scimitar and a large fruit bat wing to Bodbin Gimple and he will put the finishing touches on what will be a fitting scimitar for a Druid of the Storm Reapers.");
